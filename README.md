## Who am I?

I have started my journey in technology when I was 12, tinkering with computers and learning to code. I have been developing my skills since then. Currently working as an Independent Consultant focused on DevOps/SRE (Kubernetes, AWS and all of that), helping adopt the Observability culture with Datadog and improving the Cybersecurity posture for companies.
