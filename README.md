## Who am I?

I have started my journey in technology when I was 12, tinkering with computers and learning to code. I have been developing my skills since then, thriving for more knowledge in this ever-evolving tech world we live in. 

I've been working as an Independent Consultant for the last 10 years, in which I've specialized on DevOps/SRE (Kubernetes, AWS...), helping adopt the Observability culture with Datadog and improving the Cybersecurity posture for companies.
